# A simple XML Schema & DTD validator

From time to time one needs to create a little showcase XSD Schema or DTD for a XML file. In this situation it would be nice to have a __really__ **simple** program to check if the XML conforms to the schema or vice versa. So that is the purpose of this little project: simply provide a standalone validator with a GUI and some educated error output (rather than claiming that there is an error anywhere in the XML file).
